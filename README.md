## Overview
As healthcare systems evolve through mergers, acquisitions, and partnerships, there is a large problem identifying and 
recognizing duplicate and erroneous information on entities such as doctors, practices, and clinics when the data from 
various sources is combined. As the number and frequency of these mergers increases, there is a growing need to establish a 
single "source of truth," using data from key business domains. Examples of these domains include healthcare provider, 
patient, payer, location, item, medication, procedures, information management and reporting, facility, diagnoses, 
guidelines, and codes. The processes for creating, managing and governing a single "source of truth" are broadly classified 
under Master Data Management (MDM).

The implemented algorithm uses Natural Language Processing in order to realise task requirements.

It was done as part of crowdsourcing contest on TopCoder: [Contest: Master Data Management](https://community.topcoder.com/longcontest/stats/?module=ViewOverview&rd=16529)
